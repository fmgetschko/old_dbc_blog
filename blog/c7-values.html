    <h1>Culture and Affirmation</h1>
    <h3>Why feel threatened?</h3>
    <h4 id="date">April 12, 2015</h4>
    <!--Put content here-->
    <p>This is a weird subject for me. Of course that I have already felt out of place in some occasions. But I can't remember of a situation where I felt threatened and this feeling has negatively impacted me. Although I'm a person who is always seeking for approval, I always fought to be authentic. I never wanted to be approved, or to belong, for being or doing or thinking like the others.</p>
    <p>I always wanted to stand out for who I am. And that's not always easy. I was kind of geek when I was a child (and in that time, that wasn't a synonim of being cool), and then I was a woman in a "menly" engineering school, and after that I was a 3rd world woman living in Europe. I could have had lots of problems because of that. But the truth is that I never felt that I was none of these things, and also never felt that people saw me like that. I always felt that I was just me, and people got who I was, my strengths and weaknesses, just like everybody. For me, this is how things work.</p>
    <p>When it comes to interpersonal relationships, my belief is that people see you as a reflection of how you behave (and expose yourself) in front of them. If you behave like you're fragile for whatever reason, people will see you as fragile, and treat you accordingly. If you don't, even if somebody tries to put you down, you'll just show that it is irrelevant, and life goes on. Maybe this is what affirmation is about. Nobody is perfect, and nobody is better than anybody. If we all feel as equals, and behave as equals, the problems will simply disappear! Sounds too simplistic? Well, it always worked for me. :)</p>
    <p>Enough of talking... now it's time to explore my values. The fulfilling values for me are and how I try to live up to these values:

      <p>Wow... that's a big list. As for chosing one value to talk about, I think I've talked a lot about confidence above, and also about how this can help me mediate stereotype threat if I feel it. So, that would be all! :)</p>
