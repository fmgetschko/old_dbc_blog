    <h1>Asking questions</h1>
    <h3>The key to success</h3>

    <p>Knowing how to ask a question, nowadays, is more essential than ever. People lack time, and we lack time, so we want to have answers to our questions asap. This extends even to Google, to whom we commonly ask questions. When we ask a good question, we get a straight answer and don't keep stuck.</p>
    <p>From these past weeks experience, I've been observing that a good question:
      <ul>
        <li>Is organized: you can't start explaining one thing, and then interrupt it to explain something else, and then return to the previous thought, and then.... no! Organize your thoughts and explain it linearly.</li>
        <li>Is objective: please, don't write the Bible to explain your thoughts. Know how to summarize it. People are less open to help you if they have to read an endless explanation of your problem.</li>
        <li>Is filled with all necessary information: you have to put your readers on the same page that you are. Nobody has a clue of what you're working on or the things you already tried. So, contextualize them. Place them on your universe, and share what you've already researched and tried.</li>
      </ul></p>
    <p>I love to dive in my colleagues problems. It's a great chance of learning something new, apart from helping someone that might be freaking out. When a good question is posed, it will always get answers. And there's more: many times, when we structure our thoughts to make a good question, we end up finding the answer before even having to ask it in fact! So, let's practice to ask good questions, and make us all more productive!</p>
