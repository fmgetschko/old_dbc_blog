    <h1>OO vs. Functional Programming</h1>
    <h3>Sooo different!</h3>

    <p>It's kind of funny to talk about OO vs. Functional Programming. I had the chance to be presented to both of them during graduation, and I can remember it just like it was yesterday!</p>
    <p>The first contact I ever had with programming was in first semester of graduation, when we learned to program C. I had no idea of how wonderful this world of programming could be, and I was amazed with the power of C. I was probably the best student attending the course at that semester, and that functional logic made a whole sense to me. By programming in C, I was able to easily and quickly solve most of my calculus problems, by structuring a step-by-step logic of the solution. The rest, the computer did for me! :)</p>
    <p>After that, I was dragged by other fundamental pilars of engineering, such as mechanics, structures, electronics, and so on. The next contact that I had with programming came much later. In my third year of graduation, I decided to dedicate my extra time to academical research. So, I chose a field of reseach: discrete events! We had a lab at school dedicated to this subject, and I talked to the professor and we decided to make an experiment: to control lab's mini parts assembly plant online.</p>
    <p>Until then, all I had programmed was C programs to calculate math nonsenses. How would I control an entire plant online? That was when I was introduced to OO world! I just couldn't control that plant through functional programming. Why? Because I couldn't predict when I would have to remotely access my plant, and neither what parts of it I would need to operate. There was not a single logical flow to follow!</p>
    <p>Apart from the PLCs, sensors, and low-level languages necessary, I had to create an OO software, in which each element of my plant was an instance of a class, and they had their properties and methods. Whenever the operator wanted to remotely control an element, he/she accessed this element in my OO program, and operated it by running the methods applicable to that element (for example: pull(method) a piston (element)). In functional programming, that would never have worked, since 'pull a piston' would have to be part of a sequential logic, that would have to be entirely run each time we wanted to try to control anything in the plant.</p>
    <p>I don't know how crazy that might sound, but this is how I intuitively (?) learnt the difference between OO and Functional Programming. And that's my story for today! </p>
