      By now, I’m getting to the end of DBC Phase 0’s first week. And I must say this is pretty exciting! Since application, DBC has been creating a friendly and engaging environment. I’m usually the type of person that takes a time to feel comfortable in a new group. And what I’ve been seeing - and it’s been just a few days - is that I am part of a receptive and eager to learn cohort, who are willing to learn by helping others learn. I feel more and more motivated each day, I feel that I fit, that I belong.

      I can’t wait to dig in new challenges, concepts, tools, knowledge, pairing. It is a little scary, I won’t lie, once I see in DBV very high standards, and I want to be able to correspond to it. Because I know that, if I do, then I’ll reach my personal goal.

      The most important thing to keep in mind is that all along this journey, we need to be open to try, to experiment and… to fail! Over and over, because this is what learning is about. I want to be 100% in this challenge, and put my best energies on it to learn how to learn, after all this is what I’ll take home and what will make me succeed from that point on.
