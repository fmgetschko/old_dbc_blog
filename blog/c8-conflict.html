    <h1>Conflicts</h1>
    <h3>They end up being healthy, after all</h3>

    <p>In the last few years, I've learnt to be constantly in conflict. I now see conflict as an inevitable path to growth. Well, it's not always been like this.</p>
    <p>I'm a person of strong beliefs. When I was younger, I sometimes had hard times to understand how people could disagree with determined values and positions. That usually made me feel disgustful, dissatisfied.</p>
    <p>Experience has shown me that radical debates usually didn't end up producing the results I wanted. Work environment was essential on that learning process. I learned to be patient with the ones who disagree with my point of view. And I started to listen to what they say. I try to understand their perspective. That helps me argueing on each one of the points the other part lists. And, repeatedly, that makes me grow solid on my perspective, or adapt and evolve on it. And that's how I learned to like conflict!</p>
