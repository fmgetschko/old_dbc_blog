    <h1>Ruby Classes</h1>
    <h3>Defining a group of objects with shared properties</h3>

    <p>This week, I'm going to explore what Ruby Classes are and why they are useful. Ruby is a object-oriented language, and it is all structured in classes. A Class defines a type of object, and it contains all characteristics that all instances of this object will have. An Integer, for example, is a Ruby Class. This means that all objects assigned as Integers share the same characteristics and can make use of the same methods.</p>
    <p>I'll try to make it more comprehensible by giving a silly example. Imagine that you want to create a Class T-Shirt. When you define this class, you define that all objects of T-Shirt class have:
      <ul>
        <li>Collar</li>
        <li>Sleeves</li>
        <li>Body</li>
      </ul></p>
    <p>Once you've defined it, for every new T-Shirt you want to create (that is, for every instance of that class), they will always automatically have these 3 characteristics that you defined for this class. You can also create a method #color for this class, that recieves a color as input and defines the color of your T-Shirt as output.</p>
    <p>Why is this useful? Well, since you know what it takes to create a T-Shirt, you don't need to start it fro scratch every time you want to make a new T-Shirt. You just create a class, define all methods and parameters for it, and then you're done! After that, all you have to do is instantiate your class to create a new object. No effort!</p>
