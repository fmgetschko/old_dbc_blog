    <h1>Stereotype Threat</h1>
    <h3></h3>

    <!--Put content here-->
    <p>I've made some research on stereotype threat. I've been giving a lot of thought lately on how impressive is the power that our mind has over us, even when we don't realize it. I think this subject is a clear example of it.</p>
    <p>In life, we're constantly compared to others, and subsequentially we're usually judged after that. Luckily, I can't recall of any ocasions that I felt compared, and (mis)judged for being a woman. That obviously doesn't mean that it never happened, it just means that it didn't bother me then.</p>
    <p>But I've probably felt affected by stereotype threat when it comes to social status. Here, down the tropics (specially in samba-land), people are constantly discriminated by their (lack of) economic possessions. Specially when you're a child or teenager, it's easy to feel uncapable of achieving something because you lack of means to do that. If you can't afford to have a private teacher, you won't be good at learning a second language; if you can't attend a sports club, you'll never be a good voleyball player; and so on. The good part of it is that you end up learning how to deal with it, and achieve your goals anyway.</p>
    <p>Nowadays, I can't really think of sterotypes or situations that may make me feel uncapable of achieving my goals. I think my obstination surpasses whatever could put me in that kind of situation. I trully believe that we can go as far as we can handle. In other words: stereotype threat? Not here!</p>
