    <p>Pair sessions are definitely being one of the most interesting parts of Phase 0. It's been a very rewarding experience to me. First of all reasons, it's a cultural experience. Since I'm not American, I've been having the chance to experience a little of american's culture through these interactions. And, so far, it seems to me that this group that I'm interacting with is very darting. And this attitude (I honestly don't know why) seems to be undervalued around here. That all said, whenever I'm pairing, I always feel that I have so much to learn from my pair (and sometimes, that makes me feel that I can't contribute to my pair as much as he/she does).</p>
    <p>And then, there's feedback. I'm not that used to feedback so much, and it's been challenging. Feedback dashboard has helped me a lot on that. I had very different evaluations for the first 3 feedbacks I gave, and having the chance to see what others evaluated as being good and bad feedback, I've drawn a strategy to all feedbacks I give: I always highlight things that my pair did that he/she should keep doing and things that he/she could improve for future sessions. This is how I managed to give specific and actionable feedback: even when I don't have anything contructive to say, I try to specifically highlight what pleased me about my pair.</p>
    <p>There's also the feedback that I get. I have this constant seek for perfectionism, so I always want to read that all and desperately think of how I can improve and go beyond. And I'm not only perfectionist, but I'm also the kind of person who seeks for approval. So, whenever there's new feedback for me, I just wish I didn't disappoint my partner. I think that's my biggest vulnerability when it comes to those pair interactions and feedbacks. At least so far, I think it all worked very well and I've been having wonderful experiences. I hope it keeps being this delightful! </p>
