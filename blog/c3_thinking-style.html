    <h1>Me: a sequential person</h1>

    <!--Put content here-->
    <p>I’m impressed with how my thinking styles descriptions match with my personality and modus operandi. And I say it in plural because I tied on 2 different thinking styles when I took the Learningweb quiz: Concrete Sequential and Abstract Sequential. As a start, it definitely means that I am a step-by-step person!</p>
    <p>Self discovery is a road explored by few, probably because it’s often sinuous and bumpy. Even though, it is also beautiful and reassuring. DBC’s been giving us the opportunity to explore it, and I am very grateful for that!</p>
    <p>So, first, I’d like to explore some aspects regarding my thinking styles that fit with my personality.<br><br>
    As a Concrete Sequential person, I:
      <ul>
        <li>stick to facts</li>
        <li>seek for logical sequence</li>
        <li>like organization</li>
        <li>am hands-on</li>
        <li>have facility to memorize specific information (such as formulas and rules)</li>
        <li>seek for approval</li>
        <li>have difficulty to deal with opposing views</li>
        <li>need peace and quiet to be productive</li>
        <li>run away from pointless discussions</li>
        <li>struggle with “use your imagination” tasks</li>
      </ul>
    <br>
    As an Abstract Sequential person, I:
      <ul>
        <li>love to be heard</li>
        <li>love to debate, but tend to monopolize conversations</li>
        <li>am usually not that diplomatic</li>
        <li>like to work alone</li>
        <li>seek perfectionism</li>
        <li>am a researcher</li>
        <li>always analyze carefully any situation before making a decision</li>
        <li>feel uncomfortable when I have few time to work on a matter</li>
        <li>don’t express my emotions often</li>
        <li>like to be in stimulating environments</li>
        <li>am terrified of seeming foolish</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>Thinking about that, and relating it to my DBC experience so far, I think DBC’s structured environment is just the right fit for me, and constant feedback matches my need for approval. Even though, my perfectionism, my difficulty to express my emotions and the fear of seeming foolish may end up making things a little more difficult to me.</p>
    <p>And, put that together with my tendency to work alone, I think that what could help me most broadening my learn spectrum is to pair as much as I can. This would force me to learn to listen to other opinions, deal with it and come to a common sense. Besides, I’m pretty sure I can learn a lot from how others approach problems. So, I think I just came to a conclusion on that. And I’ll do my best to put this finding in practice!</p>
