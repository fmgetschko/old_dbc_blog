    <h3>A learning experience</h3>

    <p>I've been reflecting on the experience to build my own blog site from scratch. It was definitely a learning experience. It was the first chance that I had to put html and css together into something meaningful, my first website! That, for itself, is no doubt valuable enough.</p>
    <p>But, if I were to start a new project like this TODAY (after having learned everything that I did in these last couple of weeks), I would chose to do that by using an existing framework. The idea is simple and strong: why should I reinvent things that have been already developed and widely used? No matter how many effort I would put into that, it obviously wouldn't be as well implemented as in any framework available out there.</p>
    <p>We should always try do direct our efforts and energy to the things that are unique in our projects. This is where we'll be able to add the most of our value. In any projects that we may have in life, it's their core business that matters the most. If we're spending most of the time in periphericals, we're lowering our chances of success. That all said, creating and maintaining this blog has been a great learning experience. But, for me, next step will be to re-adapt it to a framework and focus its maintainance on what really matters: write posts!</p>
