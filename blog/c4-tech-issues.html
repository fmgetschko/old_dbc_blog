    <h1>Net Neutrality</h1>
    <h3>The importance of freedom</h3>
    <h4 id="date">March 21, 2015</h4>
    <!--Put content here-->
    <p>Technology is only a child. And, as every kid, it is evolving to a more mature stage. At this phase, several subjects raise and need to be clarified for a brighter future. And, today, I chose to talk about a major concern on the table: Net neutrality.</p>
    <p>Net neutrality concept states that internet service providers should enable access to all content and applications regardless of the source, and without favoring or blocking particular products or websites. That means that there cannot be any sort of traffic differentiation by user, content, platform, application or mode of communication.</p>
    <p>The importance of it is huge. Net neutrality is what guarantees that public information that exists on the web has to be equally available to everyone. And that nobody can have privileged access to it over anybody else. It guarantees that we won't be overcharged to access any sort of public content, and that we won't be overcharged to have easier access to it. Access to information should be, by principle, everybody's right, indiscriminately. </p>
    <p>Believe it or not, Brazil is pioneer and an example to be followed on this matter. It's been one year now that we had approved on congress the Brazilian Civil Right Framework for the Internet. This framework was built under a tripod: freedom, privacy and neutrality of the internet. Brazil was the first country in the world to have this kind of guidelines approved, and it was a big victory that this move was disassociated to the national telecommunication regulation organ and telecom companies in general.</p>
    <p>US has just had approved its guideline on net neutrality. This is to be celebrated, no doubts. The biggest issue on that move is that these guidelines are under FCC. Even though they assure the level of neutrality needed, it seems a little uncomfortable to have it controlled by the telecommunication regulation organ. That's why it's vital that US citizens keep engaged and vigilant on this matter, to prevent that conflicts of interests might end up distorting this essential pilar for the future of the web.</p>
